## Inspiration
### Simple Inspiration Guideline:

#### getting inspired : the secret ingredient for stunning web design!####

##### use other websites as inspiration to see what other leading designers are _doing right_

1. collect design that you like - that I think well design
2. Try to understand everything about them by answering those questions:
   1. Why do they look good?
   1. What do this sites have in common?
   1. How were they built in css and html?

## Sell
#### Sell a book or whatever Guideline

##### Super effective ways to improve your website's conversion

1. build trust with your future customer
  1. example with a free book, if the user likes your book, is more likely to buy other stuff
  1. you should have a strong **(help Joann at 0:46s)** button and repeat thise button on many place, more often is better but without spending and frustrating the user
  is good to have the same code for those button, with the same color but with different style(background transparent or not, border or not)
  - grab your user attention, it's popular to use a popup box because the conversion is very good.
  - tell your user the benefit:
    1. tell your user the benefit to click on the button
    1. instead said boring like "click here" or "sign up" tell your user he should try the service 
    1. for free. that is much better
    1. _always use a  word describe the benefit the user get by clicking a button: "TRY IT FOR FREE"_

5. Don't ask for too much information
   - the user don't like to use to many form to achieve something, a few field definitively convert better 

6. use social proof it very good tactic to increase convertion
   1. By Showing others companies use your product or service, this tactic is incredelly effective because customer are more likely
 to trust others than to trust you. 

7. use urgency
  1. it means like the buyer he needs quickly, like a button _limit time remaining_
  1. use word like, now, instantsly, immediately, etc.
  1. this technique is extremely effective.

7. use scaricity
  1. product in short supply _like Only 1 left in stock_

## image

#### image on top with text on top

#### Heading and text
1. keep them grouped together with not to much line-height between them.
  - they need to look like a unit.
2. Overlay the image with black to see the white heading better,
with heavey font(Bold) for the text.
3. We can use other overlay colors or gradient.
4. Put your text in a box with opacity or solid color
  - Put your text in a box choose the box color goes with the image and some opacity.
  - Use the color wheel for the boxes and font color.
5. Blur the image
   - Photo with focus, put the text on the blurd part(out focus)
6. The floor fade   
   -  ex with a bottom black with white text, look at the image example


## spacing and layout

   - example bad page with the smile magic original
   - Put whitespace between your elments
   - Put whitespace between your groups of elements
   - Put whitespace between your site's section
   - But don't exagerate

## terminolgy

- readability: I wnat to do this fade for readability
- whitespace: means the empty space
- content: all the text and image
